### My first React project

# About
The site displays a roster of real-life professional wrestlers, and has an option to view the roster filtered by a certain category

# Things I learned:
- React state
- Code modularization with components
- Production vs deployment
- Basic version control with Git

# Usage
You can view the site at [this link](https://sakib-avdibasic.github.io/fighters-react-app/)
